## Introduction
I was assigned the task of bringing out insight from the insight from this data which has helped me practice my data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation skills.

**_Disclaimer_** : _All datasets and reports do not represent any company, institution or country, but just a dataset to demonstrate capabilities of Power BI._

## Problem Statement
1. What is the worth in Â£ of the total sales and profit?
2. Which product has the highest revenue in the current year?
3. What is the worth in Â£ of the total revenue by country and segment?
4. How does the discount by product look like?

## Power BI Concepts/Skills Applied:
The following Power BI features were incorporated:
- DAX; Calculated Columns, Measure calculation, Custom Columns 
- Filters
- Visualisation

## Data Sourcing
After assessing the questions above, I went ahead to extract the data from its source in CSV file into Power BI for cleaning, analysis, and visualisation.

It contains a table with 700 rows and 14 columns

## Data Transformation/Cleaning

Data was efficiently cleaned using the Power Query Editor of Power BI. (A screenshot of the applied steps). Some of the applied steps included: 

- Making the first row as headers in the table
- Analytic transformation of the table; to create measures and new columns such as Average Unit Sold = AVERAGE(FinData[Units Sold]), Revenue = FinData[Units Sold] * FinData[Sales Price], Average Profit = Average(FinData[Profit])
- Data type changed from 'TEXT' to 'WHOLE NUMBER', 'WHOLE NUMBER' to 'CURRENCY'
- Deleting irrelevant columns
